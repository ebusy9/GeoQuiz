## Project requirements
This project had to meet the following requirements.
#### Design
* In all screen formats, the application should work without a horizontal scrollbar.
* The application optimally utilizes the entire screen on all devices.
* The design is clean, modern, simple, and intuitive.

#### Account
* As an unregistered user, I can log in by entering only my username. No password is required. If the username is not found in the database, a new user is created, and I am logged into my profile. If the username is already in the database, I am logged in and redirected to the quiz.
  
#### List of users and scores
* As a logged-in user, I can access a list of all users and their best scores.

#### Quiz
* As a logged-in user, I answer randomly selected quiz questions.
* As a logged-in user, I cannot edit my chosen answers.
* As a logged-in user, my response changes to green or red upon selection, and the "next" button becomes active.
* As a logged-in user, I have a time limit to answer questions.
* As a logged-in user, I view the results in a table of scores and a bar graph.

## New version

</br>
In the first version, we used `<input type="radio">`, requiring users to click three times to answer a question and move to the next one.
</br>
We decided to create a new version with `<button>` elements, enabling users to answer a question and move to the next one in a single click, along with some other improvements
</br>
### New version features:
* Enhanced scoring system
* Dynamic animated timer
* One-click question responses
* Randomized display of answer options
